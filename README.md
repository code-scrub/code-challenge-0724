# Create a Node project that can retrieve and display blog posts from a test API

Create API using NodeJS and Express

Basic project description: Node app that uses Express as the web application framework. 

The API exposes three endpoints:
1.
/
(root) GET request. This is the root of the application. It simply renders on the screen the message "Liberty Mutual Blog Application"

2.
/posts
GET request. This endpoint will return a list blog posts. You will get the posts from the test API web site jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
The list of blog posts will be printed on your web page. No special formatting is required.

3.
/posts/id
GET request. This endpoint will return a specific blog post. You will get the posts from the test API web site jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/id
The info for the blog post will be printed on your web page. No special formatting is required.

Technologies to use:
1. Node.JS
2. Express
3. EJS view engine

Extra credit if you want to do any of the following:
1. Make the display of the items attractive on the page using HTML/CSS
2. Create an endpoint for creating a blog post
3. Create an endpoint for getting all blog posts for a given user
